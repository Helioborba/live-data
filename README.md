# Live data
## This repo contains a working version for chart.js live update using react hooks.
Change the client for whatever technology you want as the backend server, for now theres a simple php for testing.
* The repo also contains Dockerfiles and a docker-compose environment in case you want to containerize the app you make or run tests with a mysql db (modify the compose file for whatever DB you may use).SS
